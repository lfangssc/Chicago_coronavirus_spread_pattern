CDC daily updates on infected cases on County level are not satisfying to address public’s concern on virus spread. On March20th, NBC5 published case information of 435 coronavirus infections. The data is relatively comprehensive and of high value for understanding on the virus spread patterns at Chicago. Data engineering and Google map technology are applied to organize the data and retrieve geographic information of the virus. The analysis shows community spread in Chicago areas has a potential proximity relation with public commuter rail.
